        <h1>American Priorities</h1>
        <img src = "/Media/American_Flag.jpeg">
        <p>American is not in the best shape right now. But Henry has a plan to <strong>help</strong> us out.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>Limited Government on the Economy</h2>
                <img src="/Media/Limited_Government.jpeg"></img>
                <p>America is a place where people can spend their <strong>passion</strong> and <strong>dreams</strong> to make a living. <br>Coupled with the rising inflation and oncoming recession, we don't need the government <br>strangling the American Dream with <strong>strict</strong> regulation and limitations on the people.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Reduced Taxes</h2>
                <img src="/Media/Reduced_Taxes.jpeg"></img>
                <p>Instead of limiting the economy by strict regulation, the government should instead support and reduce taxes for businesses that fuel the economy. <br>Individual <strong><em>achievement</em></strong> leads to individual <strong><em>success</em></strong>.<br><br>Reducing taxes also helps everyone in America, the economy, the country, will <strong>prosper</strong> and the tradeoff will be worth for everyone involved</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Gun Control</h2>
                <img src="/Media/Gun_Control.jpeg"></img>
                <p>Last year there were <strong>694,050 violent crimes</strong> in the US, a <strong>28.64%</strong> increase from last year!<br><br> Henry believes that everyone should be allowed their <strong>constitutional</strong> right to bear arms and safety. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Streamline Immigration Process</h2>
                <img src="/Media/Immigration.jpeg"></img>
                <p>America is built on <em>diversity</em> and <em>dreams</em>. We warmly welcome <strong>legal</strong> immigrants but illegal immigration will be turned away. <br>We need to <strong>streamline</strong> our immigration process so that it is easier to gain legal citizenship.  <br><br>Our immigration policy is not a process of prejudice or racism, but a process of <strong>safety</strong>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Current Priorities Trump Environmental Regulations</h2>
                <img src="/Media/American_Priorities.png"></img>
                <p>We need to focus on the <strong>dozens</strong> of present problems facing America right now: <strong>an economic recession, Covid-19, poverty.</strong><br><br> Environmental regulations will be a <strong>burden</strong> on the already straining economy.<br>When we solve our problems, we can then tackle global warming <em>together</em>. Helping the present <strong>will</strong> help the future.
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Main Point</h2>
                <p>Henry's main point is to <strong>help</strong> the people protect and build their livelihoods for themselves, just like how he struggled to do. He believes individual <strong>independence</strong> and <strong>self-sufficiency</strong> will create a <strong>better, stronger</strong> America.
